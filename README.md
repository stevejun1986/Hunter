# Hunter. This code is written on Python 2.7.13 with the following libs installed: 
# pcapng (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-pcapng)
# arp_table (http://python-arptable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html). 

# The goal of the program is to seek out pairs of MAC addresses from the ARP table and logs from network sniffing tools (in pcap format).
# When a pair is found, it is disgarded. We are only looking for mismatched MAC addresses to find potentially harmful systems

# *As of 01/27/2017 this is a work in progess and not ready for completion.
